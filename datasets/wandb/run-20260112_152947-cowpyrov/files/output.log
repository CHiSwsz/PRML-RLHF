Including non-PyTorch memory, this process has 11.74 GiB memory in use. Of the allocated memory 10.71 GiB is allocated by PyTorch, and 738.22 MiB is reserved by PyTorch but unallocated. If reserved but unallocated memory is large try setting PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:True to avoid fragmentation.
