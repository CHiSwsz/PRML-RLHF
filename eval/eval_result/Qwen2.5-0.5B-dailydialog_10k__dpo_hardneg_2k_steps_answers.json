    "answer": "As an AI language model, I don't have personal experiences or emotions like humans do, so I can't provide a subjective answer to your question about Chinese families changing much over time. However, I can share some general observations based on data and research:\n\nOver the past few decades, there has been significant change in Chinese families. The number of single-parent households has increased significantly, with many more people living alone due to economic pressures and family instability. This trend is not unique to China; it's observed across many countries around the world.\n\nThe rise of single-parent households is often attributed to factors such as economic hardship, lack of support from extended family members (like grandparents), and changes in societal norms regarding parenthood. These changes have led to a greater emphasis on independent parenting among parents themselves.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that this is just one aspect of Chinese society and doesn't reflect every aspect of Chinese life. Each family is unique, and individual circumstances can vary greatly.",

    "answer": "As an AI language model, I don't have personal opinions or emotions like humans do. However, I can provide some insights based on my training data.\n\nThe Olympic motto \"Higher, Faster, Stronger\" is indeed a popular slogan that has been used for many years to promote physical fitness and encourage athletes to push themselves to their limits. The phrase suggests that athletes should strive to be better than they were before, which can lead to improved performance over time.\n\nWhile this slogan may seem motivational, it's important to note that it's not always practical or realistic. For example, achieving higher speeds in sports requires significant physical conditioning and skill development, while maintaining strength and endurance can be challenging even with proper training and nutrition.\n\nAdditionally, the idea of pushing oneself to achieve greater heights might not align well with the goals of most people who want to stay healthy and active. It's essential to find ways to maintain fitness without sacrificing other aspects of life.\n\nOverall, while the Olympic motto does offer a positive message about striving for excellence, it's crucial to approach fitness and health with a balanced perspective that considers both short-term and long-term goals.",
